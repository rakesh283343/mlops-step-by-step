This repository contains hands-on labs and code samples that demonstrate best practices and patterns for implementing and operationalizing production grade machine learning workflows on Google Cloud Platform. 

## Navigating this repository
This repository is organized into two sections:
- [Hands-on Labs](./labs/README.md)
- [Code samples](./examples/README.md)

### Hands-on Labs
This section contains a portfolio of hands-on labs designed to support development and delivery of instructor led ML Engineering workshops. Each lab includes the detailed setup instructions and a summary of lab exercises. The labs are grouped into the series that have to be executed in sequence as the subsequent labs depend on the successful outcome of the preceding labs.

It is expected that instructors will pick and choose from the lab portfolio to create a customized workshop.

### Code Samples
This section compiles code samples demonstrating design and code patterns for a variety of ML Engineering topics. Each code sample is standalone and contains a brief description of the illustrated pattern.
