# TFX Components Walk-through

In this lab you will walk through the configuration and execution of core TFX Components. The primary goal of the lab is to get a high level understanding of the function and usage of each of the components.

## Lab scenario

Using the [Covertype Data Set](https://github.com/jarokaz/mlops-labs/blob/master/datasets/covertype/README.md) you will develop a multi-class classification model that predicts the type of forest cover from cartographic data.

You will work in a Jupyter notebook using TFX Components in an interactive mode to analyze and prepare data, and to train and deploy a TensorFlow model.


## Lab setup

### AI Platform Notebook configuration
You will use the **AI Platform Notebooks** instance provisioned in the `lab-01-environment-notebook` lab. For this lab you don't need the KFP environment.


## Lab Exercises

Follow the instructor who will guide you through the `tfx-walkthrough.ipynb` notebook.
