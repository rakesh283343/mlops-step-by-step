# Hands-on Labs

- **Series 0x labs**. These labs guide you through the process of provisioning and configuring a reference MLOps environment on GCP. Most other labs rely on the environment configured in these labs. 
    - **lab-00-environment-setup** is a fully automated one-step deployment of the lab environment. 
    - **lab-01-environment-notebook** and **lab-02-environment-kfp** are alternatives to **lab-00-environment-setup** where the provisioning of an AI Platform Notebook instance and Kubeflow Pipelines have been separated into two labs.
    

- **Series 1x labs**. These labs walk you through the process of authoring and operationalizing KFP pipelines that utilize GCP managed services to train and deploy machine learning models:
    
- **Series 2x labs**. These labs teach how to develop and operationalize **Tensorflow Extended (TFX)** pipelines

- **Series 3x labs**. These labs are deep-dives into **TensorFlow Data Validation**, **TensorFlow Transform**, and **TensorFlow Model Analysis** libraries.
