# Using Kubeflow Pipelines to orchestrate AutoML Tables and BigQuery

In this lab, you develop an ML pipeline that uses BigQuery for feature engineering and 
AutoML Tables for model training and deployment.

The lab requires a full environment setup as described in *Lab-00-Environment-Setup*, including an **AI Platform Notebook** instance based on the custom container.
